                <br>
                <div>I have been an aspiring computer scientist ever since I got a TI-84 calculator when I was 12. I am constantly learning about new things and I always go really deep into each of the subjects.</div>
                <br>
                <div>So far I have worked with 3D rendering, low level and high level game development, computer language design and runtime development, front end web development, physics engine development, fully custom cpu development all the way down to the logic gates, machine learning...
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>I have learned lots of programming languages throughout the years, but so far, rust is my favorite. I am happy programming in almost any language though.
